### PixelsCamp workshop
# Build a Vue.js app from scratch with Vue CLI 3

This repo contains the presentation *PixelsCamp_presentation.pdf* and the code that was made during the Workshop at PixelsCamp. I've added some comments close to the implementations with links to the oficial Vue's 
documentation if you want to know more about a specific functionality.


## Requirements
- Node.js 8.11.0+ recommended (https://nodejs.org/)

> _Check which version do you have with “node -v” on the terminal_


- Vue CLI 3 by running “**npm install -g @vue/cli**” on the terminal

> _Check which version do you have with “vue -V” on the terminal. If you have the previous vue-cli (1.x or 2.x) package installed globally, you need to uninstall it first with “npm uninstall vue-cli -g”_

## Create a project

Simply run the command below and follow the instructions.

```
vue create [project_name]
```

If you prefer to use a GUI:

```
vue ui
```
